This project introduces parallelism at the process level using the hybrid parallel architecture of Message Passing Interface and OpenMP, to implement computer vision edge-detection task using Sobelâ€“Feldman operator on videos. This model successfully shows the implementation and design of parallel architecture and represents the significance of parallelism when the input in terms of frames and parallel architecture in terms of thread and process increase, the problem is parallelized. The outcome of this study shows that the execution time of the algorithm decreased by enhancing parallelism.

There are two repositiories in the project "v1_image" and "v2_image"

v1_image: It applies the Sobel Feldman operator on the image on the parallel architecture.

v2_image: It applies the the Sobel Feldman operator for edge detection on the input video based on hybrid parallel architecture.
